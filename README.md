## Purpose

To increase my proficiency at developing progressive web applications.


## Installation

The application can be accessed at the [Render deployment URL](#project-status). It can be used without installing any dependencies. However, the application can be run in development mode by first cloning the repo, running "npm i" in the client, server, and root directories. Next, build the client-side assets by opening a terminal from within the client directory and running "npm run build". Finally, start the application by opening a terminal from the root directory and running "npm run start:dev". Navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal to use the application.


## Usage

Users can write code using this JATE PWA. It operates either online or offline thanks to Workbox, our service worker, our use of caching, and our APIs. The application can also be installed and run natively from a user's device.
